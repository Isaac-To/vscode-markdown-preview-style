A more formal style

## Why?

I end up submitting a lot of my homework and documentation using Markdown + Katex (Latex through JS) through VS Code for my classes and what better way to look _professional_ than to use a simple and old looking theme reminiscent of textbooks?

If you like the vibe, feel free to use this as well. Instructions to do so are included below.

I won't be committing to this much but I'll try to keep it working across updates.

## Add to your install:

1. Open user settings
2. Under Markdown Styles add:
```

```
3. Reload VS Code and enjoy!
